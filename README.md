## Steps to create the project

2. Ran "npm init -y" in the terminal to create a standard package.json file that contains all of the installed packages.
3. Ran "npm i inquirer@6.5.0v" to install the inquirer pack, which allows node to run the interactive command lines asking for user input.
4. Wrote the code (markdown, table of contents and badge functions added to generateMarkdown.js file, and questions with the inquirer initialize function in the index.js file).
4. Ran "node index.js" to see the Readme file sections where data can be entered, enter information required, write it to README file.
5. Add, commit and push the files on Github.
